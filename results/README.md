This folder contains results of experimental runs.

The subfolders are named `generator1=X,generator2=Y,model.name=Z`.
They contain (in `results.jsonl`) the results for model `Z` on the task of distinguishing fables generated by `X` from those generated by `Y`.
`generator=human` means the corresponding fables are taken from the human-generated [understanding_fables](https://github.com/google/BIG-bench/blob/main/bigbench/benchmark_tasks/understanding_fables/task.json) dataset from BIG-bench.
