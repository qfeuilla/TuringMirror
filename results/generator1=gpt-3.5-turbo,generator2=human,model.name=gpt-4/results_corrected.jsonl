As he was dying, the hawk noticed that the feathers adorning the arrow were his own and lamented: \"How tragic that I must die of an arrow that would not exist without my help.\"","fable2":"In a peaceful forest, a clever rabbit and a cunning snake lived side by side, always wary of each other. One day, the rabbit stumbled upon a hidden stash of delicious carrots, far too many for him to consume alone. Smiling, he had an idea. Pretending to befriend the snake, he offered to share his carrot treasure, but only if the snake would guard it for them both. The snake, tempted by the feast, agreed.
