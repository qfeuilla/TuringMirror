He thought it was another dog with a bigger bone. Dropping his bone, he jumped into the stream to steal the other dog's larger bone. But there was no other dog. As he splashed about searching for it, his own bone sank and was lost. When at last the dog came out of the water, he had nothing. In greedily grasping at the shadow, he had lost the substance.", "id": 1}
