Though the work was difficult, it brought him joy to provide for his loved ones. One day, a cunning fox offered the lion a quick and easy way to get food - simply steal it from others. At first, the lion was hesitant, but gave in to the temptation of effortless pleasure. For a time, he enjoyed the spoils of his theft. But soon, the other animals shunned him for his dishonesty.

The poor rabbit never saw it coming. He should have been warier when the fox winked at him earlier. A subtle sign can betray as much malice as an outright threat. The end.", "id": 57}

The next day, the fox returned to find the farmer happily picking grapes. The farmer called out to the fox, \"Thank you for sparing my crop.

Later that day when the lion became trapped in a hunter's net, he called to the fox and wolf for help. But they refused, reminding him he had not shared the deer.

But the more he fed the crows, the more they invaded his field, having grown accustomed to the free food. Soon the crows had devoured all the farmer's corn while he helplessly watched his hard work disappear.

It landed on the ground with a thud, its wing bent at an odd angle. The mother bird looked down anxiously from the nest above. \"Don't give up!\" she called encouragingly. The young bird struggled to its feet. Though its wing hurt terribly, it was determined to be brave. Hop by hop, it made its way up the tree trunk. At last, it reached its mother's waiting wings in the nest. With time and care, its wing would heal.", "id": 160}

Dazed, he slowly swam back to the surface. The other frogs laughed as he crawled onto the bank covered in mud. From then on, that frog took more care when choosing where to jump.
